JLinkGrammar is a Java port of the Carnergie Mellon University
link grammar parser, a syntactic parser for English.
The link grammar parser is a natural language parser based on
link grammar theory.   Given a sentence, the system assigns to the sentence
a syntactic structure consisting of a set of labeled links connecting pairs of
words.  The parser also produces a "constituent" representation of a
sentence (showing noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.).
