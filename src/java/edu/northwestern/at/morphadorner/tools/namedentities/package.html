<p>
AdornWithNamedEntities adorns texts with named entities such as person,
location, time, date, and organization.
</p>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
java edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.tools.namedentities.AdornWithNamedEntities outputdirectory input1.xml input2.xml ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
outputdirectory -- output directory to receive xml files adorned with named entities.<br />
input*.xml -- input TEI XML files.<br />
</p>
<p>
Note:  The named entity adorner does not always recognize entities which cross soft tags.
Thus "<hi>Emma</hi> Woodhouse" may be recognized as two separate entities.
AdornedWithNamedEntities should be run on the input files before their
submission to MorphAdorner.
