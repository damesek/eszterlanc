<p>
Compare string counts in two files using Dunning's log-likelihood.
</p>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
java edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.tools.comparestringcounts.CompareStringCounts analysis.tab reference.tab
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
analysis.tab -- Input tab-separated file of strings and counts
for an analysis text.<br />
reference.tab -- Input tab-separated file of strings and counts
for a reference text.<br />
</p>

<p>
The analysis.tab and reference.tab files contain strings and
counts of those strings compiled from two texts or corpora.
Both files contain two tab-separated columns.
The first column is a string.
The second column contains the count of the number
of times that string occurred in the associated text.
</p>

<p>
The output contains seven tab-separated columns,
sorted in descending order by log-likelihood value.
One line of output appears for each string in the
analysis text.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The first column contains the string.  This may be
a spelling, a lemma, a part of speech, a spelling bigram,
or any other string of interest.
</li>

<li>
The second column contains a "+" when the string is overused in
the analysis text with respect to the reference text, a "-" when the
string is underused, and a blank when the string is used the same
amount in both texts.
</li>

<li>
The third column contains Dunning's log-likelihood value.
</li>

<li>
The fourth column shows the relative frequency of occurrence of the string
in the analysis text as fractional parts per ten thousand.
</li>

<li>
The fifth column shows the relative frequency of occurrence of the string in
the reference text as fractional parts per ten thousand.
</li>

<li>
The sixth column shows the number of times the string
occurred in the analysis text.
</li>

<li>
The seventh column shows the number of times the string
occurred in the reference text.
</li>

</ol>
<p>
These results are written to the standard output file which can be
redirected to another file.  A brief summary of the analysis is written
to the standard error file.
