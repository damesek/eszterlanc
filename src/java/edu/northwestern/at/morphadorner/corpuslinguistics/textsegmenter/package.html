<h3>
Text Segmentation.
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Text Segmentation</strong> attempts to determine boundaries
between topics in long documents by dividing the document text into
<em>text segments</em>.  Each segment comprises a consecutive
sequence of sentences or paragraphs sharing a coherent topic.
</p>

<p>
All MorphAdorner segmenters must implement the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.corpuslinguistics.textsegmenter.TextSegmenter}
interface.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.corpuslinguistics.textsegmenter.TextSegmenterFactory}
provides the mechanism for instantiating a default or specified instance
of a segmenter implementation.
</p>

<p>
MorphAdorner includes two text segmenters, both based upon
code written by Freddy Choi.
