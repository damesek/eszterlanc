Splits text into sentences.
</h3>

<p>
Extracting words and sentences from a text are fundamental operations
required by other language processing functions. Word tokenization splits a
text into words and punctuation marks. Sentence splitting assembles the
tokenized text into sentences.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing the end of a sentence is not an easy task for a computer.
In English, punctuation marks that usually appear at the end of a sentence
may not indicate the end of a sentence. The period is the worst offender. A
period can end a sentence but it can also be part of an abbreviation or
acronym, an ellipsis, a decimal number, or part of a bracket of periods
surrounding a Roman numeral. A period can even act both as the end of an
abbreviation and the end of a sentence at the same time. Other the other
hand, some poems may not contain any sentence punctuation at all.
</p>

<p>
Another problem punctuation mark is the single quote, which can introduce a
quote or start a contraction such as 'tis. Leading-quote contractions are
uncommon in contemporary English texts, but appear frequently in Early
Modern English texts.
</p>

<p>
Few literary texts which have already been marked up using SGML or XML
recognize sentences in the markup. (The Chadwick-Healey archive of
eighteenth century novels is a notable counterexample.) Sentences often
cross other element boundaries. Texts without sentence markup require
preprocessing to add it without disturbing the existing markup. This allows
further processing of the texts, in particular, part of speech tagging and
name recognition. MorphAdorner allows pluggable input and output processors
to handle reification of texts and addition of extra markup as needed.
</p>

<p>
MorphAdorner's default sentence splitter uses the standard Java
BreakIterator class along with a set of heuristics for determining if two
or more sentences generated by BreakIterator should be joined into one
sentence. The heuristics include special treatment of sentence-ending
brackets (right parenthesis, right bracket, and right brace) and
abbreviations. The resulting sentence extraction is not perfect but is
better than BreakIterator's splitting and much better than naive splitting
methods.

All MorphAdorner sentence splitters must implement the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.corpuslinguistics.sentencesplitter.SentenceSplitter}
interface.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.corpuslinguistics.sentencesplitter.SentenceSplitterFactory}
provides the mechanism for instantiating a default or specified instance
of a SentenceSplitter implementation.
The {@link edu.northwestern.at.morphadorner.corpuslinguistics.sentencesplitter.AbstractSentenceSplitter}
serves as a base class for deriving concrete implementations of
sentence splitters.
